Okay got a meeting with Jethro at 16:30.

Things I gotta get fixed:
    [x] tetra transforms world point into local coordinates 
    [ ] make sure it cant go negative or zero
    [ ] fix the start so you face forwards and the mouse is immediately locked in

Other things to think about:
    [ ] connected tetras
    [ ] get more writing done on report

Being alive doesnt even feel like being alive any more.
