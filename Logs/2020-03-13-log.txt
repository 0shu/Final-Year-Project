It's like 2am, and I can't sleep.
I've been doing  awfully at this project.
I honestly hate it. And I'm not too best pleased with the tutors either.
I just feel lost, and although I'm able to see quite plainly that I'm not doing well I dont know how to get help.
I dont really trust anyone to ask for help. And so I can't be honest about what's really wrong.

I remember back in first year I was working on my project in the labs when a guy had his viva there.
He did terribly, it seemed like everything was just cobbled together last minute.
I remember thinking "wow, sucks to be him. I wont ever be like that guy!"
Yet here I am. Less than 2 months til submission with basically f*ck all to show. It's systemic to the module.
Yes, I am going to be frank in these logs as I write them. Deal with it. Expletives are part of how I honestly feel.

My new plan, is to git and log everything.
Write what I do, how I feel. Commit every piece of code, no matter how shitty.
I'm in a real bind here. I've thought about killing myself, but that'd make my mum so sad.
The solution is just to be totally, no holds barred open about everything.
Acting tough, hiding/obscuring facts, none of that is gonna get me a finished project.
But if I just put in as close to 300 hours as I can get and document every second,
then maybe even if I fail the course leader might show me a crumb of mercy and give me 40%.

My goals are thus:
- try to stumble across the finish line with at least a pass
- don't die before I get there

I'll see you on the other side.
