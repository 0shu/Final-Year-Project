(14:57)
Didn't do any work yesterday as was super busy on engine in the day and then totally burned out in the evening.

Stuff to get done today as per the theorising/reflection from yesterday:
    - Separate out visual and mechanical aspects of vertex mesh stuff I already made
    - Write up meeting reports (x2) for meetings with jethro

    - make method for measuring volume of unity mesh
    - get it to run on a compute shader in real time
