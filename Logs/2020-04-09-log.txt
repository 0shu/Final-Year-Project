I'm having a lot of negative thoughts lately,
and often I'm struggling to form coherent useful thoughts at all.

Focus is something I'm really struggling for, and I dont know what to do.
I really cant afford to lose focus or waste any time.
Ideally I'd spend every second of every available working hour on this project,
and yet for some reason, some defect of mind and process: I cant.

And that's terrifying. Because I want to.
I want to do well, and yet there's a very real chance that through some fault of my mind I might completely fail.

I jsut need to relax and stop beating myself up.
I need to stretch my back and unclench my jaw.

I need to forgive myself for existing, and stop loathing my flaws.
It brings forth sad questions about my future. Who am I? What am I even going to do with my life?
Why does this keep happening and how do I break out?

I dont know how to solve those questions yet,
but I do have questions about this module I can be asking too.
This whole time I've wanted a realistic simulation.
Well now I just want a simulation at all.
Let's assess the situation.

There's under a month left, 4 weeks to be exact.
By submission what things do I need?
- 8000 words of report on what I've done here.
- A somewhat working system to show off.

I also need to get enough time done into all the other modules too.
