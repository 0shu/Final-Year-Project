Here we go!
I'm ready to do another few hours of work!
Just installing the latest new version of Unity.
Since I'm forced to update by one level I might as well update to the latest, I have a backup in case it doesnt work.

So, the RW buffer seems to work when its my own struct of tetrahedrons, but not when its buffers of verts and indices.

Strategy has been sorely lacking in this project and this year as a whole.
That I guess I am to blame for

Oh my gosh I spent way too long distracted, my bad.
Thought I'd just get a little done whilst I awaited the unity download and boom, more than an hour gone!
I must press on!

Goddammit just crashed my PC again.
This stuff is really frustrating.

Days work:
- Tried playing about getting compute shader to work and had little to no success.
- I think I need to start off really simply, having multiple buffers just doesnt seem to be working.
- This might be fast becoming a dead end and just wasting tons of important time.
