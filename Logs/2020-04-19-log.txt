Got a meeting with Jethro soon.

Today I added functionality so that the segmented bar works by being clicked with the point locator active.
It can also feel the affects of physics.
Also added physics to the cubic scaling objects.

Next goals are to add the simple tetrahedron methods into the program and to expand on that functionality.

Then to put all existing functions into one scene (Sandbox).

Then to try attaching different sub-meshes together into a larger mesh.

Also got to write 8000 words and expand the report plan to include current/future work.
