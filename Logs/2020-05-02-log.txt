Been working on stuff this morning!
Added a gradient so that between 0-1800 kelvin the colour corresponds.
Added a heat glow class to make the metal change based on heat, also emits.
Downloaded a new package to enable post processing effects.
Now the hot emmissive metals also have a glow~
Did another camera for rendering the locator without bloom.

NEXT TODOS:
    - Make the existing stuff use
