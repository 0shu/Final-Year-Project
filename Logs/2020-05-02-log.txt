Been working on stuff this morning!
Added a gradient so that between 0-1800 kelvin the colour corresponds.
Added a heat glow class to make the metal change based on heat, also emits.
Downloaded a new package to enable post processing effects.
Now the hot emmissive metals also have a glow~
Did another camera for rendering the locator without bloom.

NEXT TODOS:
    - Make the existing stuff use heat as a property
    - Hotbar for heating/holding/hitting/saving

(17:14)
Pointer can now do 3 of 4 main things, just cant move stuff yet.
Keyboard controls can change modes, colour changes so you know what you're doing.
    Blue = move (not working)
    Yellow = hit (working, changes shape based on class on model)
    Red = torch (working, heats up thing and makes it glow)
    Green = Camera (working, saves model to OBJ)

NEXT TODOS:
    - Tie heat into how hit works                [ ]
    - Make moving stuff work around              [ ]
    - Hotbar asset and scrolling to control it   [ ]
    - Pause screen and ability to return to menu [âœ“]
