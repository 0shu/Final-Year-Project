Got a meeting with Jethro at 4:30pm
Gonna try and make my meshes move with hits so I've got something at least cool to show him.

(14:42)
Got a function which applies motion through the grid.
ATM the resulting vertices with nowhere to pass thier energy get moved a lot.
Ideally I'd like to rein that in a bit.
