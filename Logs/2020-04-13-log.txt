Yesterday's work was good, but I decided to scrap a large portion of it to write up a better outline of how the report should be.
Still have the old version saved in case i wanna go back and use some of it.
Was a good warmup either way!
The new report will be structured well, and aesthetics of titles and the contents page have been more considered!

Decided to split different mechnics into their own scenes to play with for now.
Made a main menu scene in the same style as the report!
