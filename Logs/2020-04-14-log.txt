Expanded on functionality built up yesterday

Now have physical level which shows what you're looking at and the direction of the normal of that face.
Calculates volume upon looking over something.

This rolls together the point locator and volume calculator as one thing.
This is useful towards reaching the end goal of having everything in one sandbox level anyways!

Next I need to look at getting the simple primitives working to work with the point locator.
Essentially I need to make functions which apply hits in directions based on a simple position/normal.
