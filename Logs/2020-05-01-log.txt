Time to kick some ass!
Was preoccupied yesterday and the day before with my shaders submission.

Now I need to do some more work on this project.
I think the key thing is to make sure I'm satisfying the aims of the project document.

I need to ensure I'm meeting the key points, which are:

    - Saving loading system         [½]
    - Hit algorithm                 [✓]
    - Visualizer for placing hits   [✓]
    - Tests                         [X]

SAVING-LOADING
==============
To achieve this we want to be able to load in arbitrary models and save models
2 main things to seach for:
    - loading models
    - saving meshes as model formats


Saving :
    Looked up .obj files https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file
    Also checked out details of an OBJ I exported from Maya

    Now know roughly how to structure the file
    So might be able to write it to a string and save to file
    Just gotta get saving to file down


Extra hit algo ideas
    - get face index from hit
    - stretch face and move it
    - find adjacent faces through shared vertices?
    - stretch those too?
    - fire ray downwards
    - only apply hit if find anvil
    - otherwise apply force to rigidbody

It saves to file now!
Wrote a custom little script that writes the data as an OBJ!
This was a fun little thing to do~
Added my own messy model from another project

Tried making another type of deformation I called SmashMesh.
Unfortunately this one is rather lame as a lot of the beauty and connected info is lost.
I thought I'd thought up a good solution, but it wont actually work.
Sinec a lot of vertices have the same poition but different normals I cant jsut compare all the tris with overlapping verts :(
Short of writing my own mesh class I cant really fix this idea and this late i nthe game its probably best just to abandon.

Gonna have to call it on FYP tonight so I can get some robotics done!
TODO for tommorow: 
    - Make whole new mesh class if feeling it.
    - Heat variable into solids (affects how manipulatable they are!)   [✓]
    - Make said heat variable affect the material colour~               [✓]
        -Unity probably has some kind of multi colour gradient tool     [✓]
