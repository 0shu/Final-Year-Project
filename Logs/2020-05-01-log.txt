Time to kick some ass!
Was preoccupied yesterday and the day before with my shaders submission.

Now I need to do some more work on this project.
I think the key thing is to make sure I'm satisfying the aims of the project document.

I need to ensure I'm meeting the key points, which are:

    - Saving loading system         [½]
    - Hit algorithm                 [✓]
    - Visualizer for placing hits   [✓]
    - Tests                         [X]

SAVING-LOADING
==============
To achieve this we want to be able to load in arbitrary models and save models
2 main things to seach for:
    - loading models
    - saving meshes as model formats


Saving :
    Looked up .obj files https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file
    Also checked out details of an OBJ I exported from Maya

    Now know roughly how to structure the file
    So might be able to write it to a string and save to file
    Just gotta get saving to file down


Extra hit algo ideas
    - get face index from hit
    - stretch face and move it
    - find adjacent faces through shared vertices?
    - stretch those too?
    - fire ray downwards
    - only apply hit if find anvil
    - otherwise apply force to rigidbody

It saves to file now!
Wrote a custom little script that writes the data as an OBJ!
This was a fun little thing to do~
Added my own messy model from another project
