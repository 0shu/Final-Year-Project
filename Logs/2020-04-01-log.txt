Unity keeps bloody crashing and its driving me round the bend.
Every other module gets me SO MUCH more progress per time spent.

I had a decent plan on the 27th.
Then I've been held up by a load of rubbish.

So to reiterate:
- Write up meeting reports and submit on blackboard
- Get the compute shader working with multiple buffers somehow?
- Get the compute shader detecting only working on indices within a mesh inside of a certain bounding box
- Write up understandable version of the theory and put on github
- Go for a walk because I've been stuck indoors too long.
