Had a small mental breakdown today whilst trying to fill out a job application.
But now it's time to get down to work.
Gonna make a few addtions to the current tetrahedron class.
Then gonna start making the building blocks of a mesh grid.
I'm going to take a slightly different approach and make something more visual based.
This will be easier to show to others, and importantly easier to debug.

Computer just crashed whilst running unity again :(((

Spent the evening working on the code, the vertices are in place now and they can already chain force down them.
Now I just have to use that force to translate them along the collision normal, then figure out how much the volume change because of that!
