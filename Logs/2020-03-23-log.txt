Had a small mental breakdown today whilst trying to fill out a job application.
But now it's time to get down to work.
Gonna make a few addtions to the current tetrahedron class.
Then gonna start making the building blocks of a mesh grid.
I'm going to take a slightly different approach and make something more visual based.
This will be easier to show to others, and importantly easier to debug.
