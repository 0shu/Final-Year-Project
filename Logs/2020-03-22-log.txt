Kept telling myself I was gonna get a load of work done on the off days between other stuff.
And then I just went full tunnel vision for engine on thurs/fri and then shaders sat/sun.

Today's plan:
- Write out definition for simple teatrahedron and then put in place simple 1-dimensional algorithm
- Scale up simple tetrahedron to work for 3 dimensional vertex translation.

There are 2 types of simple tetrahedron:
> point-face
> line-line

The types of complex tetrahedron include:
> 4-point
> line-face
> face-face

Work so far includes:
- reinstalled unity and unity hub, this apperas to have fixed problems with my project
- made new unity project to do the work in
- zipped up old project and moved it out of directory (kept copy as backup in case of emergency)

- so far I've got tetrahedrons working with lines that can have their vertices transformed 1 dimensionally
next I need to get the base triangle expanding but remaining similar

There's 6 reversible transformations:
point-point - 1D
point-line - 2x 1D
point-face - 2D
line-face - 1Dangular or 2D
line-line - 2x 1D
face-face - 2Dangular

- Got a simple 1D hit algo working with base area resizing.
It was simpler  than i thought it might be in the end. Feel like im going crazy after doing all that tho.
Lots of watching random youtube and reading articles, trig/geometry is hard man.
Gonna implement a simple size calculator for tetras to make sure its always resizing correctly!

Okay I think I've done enough for today, 5 hours or so.
I'd love to do more but I'm already feeling fatigued and like throwing up. Maybe I've got long covid?
Either way existence is hell, my brain is full of static, and I'm done.

Tomorrows goals:
- impl 3D simple tetrahedron
- line-angle variant?
