Kept telling myself I was gonna get a load of work done on the off days between other stuff.
And then I just went full tunnel vision for engine on thurs/fri and then shaders sat/sun.

Today's plan:
- Write out definition for simple teatrahedron and then put in place simple 1-dimensional algorithm
- Scale up simple tetrahedron to work for 3 dimensional vertex translation.

There are 2 types of simple tetrahedron:
> point-face
> line-line

The types of complex tetrahedron include:
> 4-point
> line-face
> face-face

Work so far includes:
- reinstalled unity and unity hub, this apperas to have fixed problems with my project
- made new unity project to do the work in
- zipped up old project and moved it out of directory (kept copy as backup in case of emergency)
