Okay, time to kick some butt!
Kinda fed up with crashing issues and low motivation so I've got a new strategy for uni work.
Gonna just start the write up now. If I act as if the computer issues are unsolvable/unworkable,
and just write up what I've done so far then even if the computer gets worse at least I'm prepared and doing something about it.
And if the computer doesnt get worse then maybe I'll finish the write up and will have enough time to do some more.
And will also have thought of some good ideas along the way!

Wrote about 1000 words on my report!
Made an interesting title page, as last submission I got marked down for my report's visuals :(
Had a good reflect on the project as a whole.
If I keep up this pace in 2 weeks I'll have a whole report written! :D
