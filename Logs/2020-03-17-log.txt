Got the go-ahead from Jethro regarding putting the project on github, yaaay!

Putting in tons of time just seems impossible, but I did a ton of work this weekend on shaders.
Nearly finished with all the content on that module, hillarious contrast to this module.
Yet I'll have more time to do this one once I've completed the other, so its still good!

Today's plan is simple:
Define all possible theoretical configurations of tetrahedrons.
Define  warping operations on those tetrahedron.
Get equations for these relationships.

Work so far:
- Created readme for project (a nice one with a linked contents page and images)
    - Descriptions of all the current parts
    - Planned future parts
    - Images & Gifs to spruce it up a bit and communicate more effectively

Checking back in after doing some work on paper.
I've identified 9 possible transformation cases.
Some of which are transaltion based, and some of which are angular based. 
I have a formula for line to face transformations and a simple one for point to face transformations.
