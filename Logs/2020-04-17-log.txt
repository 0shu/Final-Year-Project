Last time was rather productive, very happy with myself.
I made the volume calculator work with the point locator and gave it an interesting UI.
Then I made it easy to apply cubic scaling method to individual vertices across any normal.

The plan for this time is to implement the simple segmented bar method.
The idea of this method is that i break up a shape into a series of connected planes.
