(7:00)
Good morning world, lets see if wwaking up earlier will do me any better!
The sun has not yet risen over the buildings and yet there's guys up already exercising at the park.
Gotta follow in that example and make my own start nice and early~

So assessment of what's been done:
I've got a compute shader that compiles and runs!
It's giving me a number back, but the number seems wrong, moving the origin around proves that it is wrong as the number changes based on the origin.
So for whatever reason one of the 12 triangles is giving me an inverse value, other than that my face selection seems to be working.
It only seems to happen when I move the origin along the x axis.
I could, try and change how faces are worked out, or I could use normals of the verts to decide.
